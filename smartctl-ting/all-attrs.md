List of all S.M.A.R.T. Attributes Including Vendor Specific.

So here's something I just gleaned from a T13 email series that I've been privy to. It's a list of all vendor specific
S.M.A.R.T. attributes by vendor as well as the basic generic ones. Not sure why it'd be useful, but you never know.

Here's the list:
