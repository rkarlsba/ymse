Getting "Help->Check for new version" to work on Windows.
=========================================================

When VeroRoute checks for a new version, all it does is look at the page

https://sourceforge.net/projects/veroroute/files/

and searches that page for text with the Version number.
That page has a secure "https" address.
The Qt library that handles https relies on the OpenSSL DLLs, 
and these are typically not included on MS Windows.

The missing DLLs on MS Windows are called

  libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll

and they need to be placed in the folder containing VeroRoute.

The DLLs support strong encryption and there are restrictions on importing/exporting
them in some countries.  Therefore I have not provided them with the release.
You will have to download them yourself.  They are available in many places,
for example from here...

I tried version 1.0.2n of the DLLs and they worked fine.
Note that you must use the appropriate DLLs for the version of VeroRoute that you have.
Use the win32 DLLs for the 32-bit version of VeroRoute (even if you are on a 64-bit system)
and the win64 version for the 64-bit version of VeroRoute.
Note that the 64-bit DLLs still have the "32" in the filename, not "64".
