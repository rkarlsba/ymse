In order for VeroRoute to import a netlist produced by gEDA,
the symbols used in the gEDA schematic must have attributes
(such as footprint names and pin numbers) that are consistent
with the conventions used in VeroRoute.


1) What is in this folder?
==========================

The "veroroute_" folders contain the VeroRoute Symbols for gEDA.
The file "veroroute-clib.scm" is the corresponding config file.


2) Configuring gEDA with the VeroRoute symbols
==============================================

You will need to use the command line and have administrator privileges.
The "veroroute_" folders must be copied to the location where gEDA keeps its symbols.
So if the "veroroute_" folders are in "/home/alex/VeroRoute/Libraries/gEDA/"
then you would do 

sudo cp -rf /home/alex/VeroRoute/Libraries/gEDA/veroroute_* /usr/share/gEDA/sym/

and then copy the config file as follows

sudo cp /home/alex/VeroRoute/Libraries/gEDA/veroroute-clib.scm /usr/share/gEDA/gafrc.d/


3) Exporting the netlist
========================

Once you have made a schematic using the VeroRoute Symbols, 
you should export the netlist in Tango format (which is very
similar to Protel 1 format) using the command line.
So if the schematic is called "mycircuit.sch" you would type:

gnetlist mycircuit.sch -g tango

This will create the file "output.net" which can be imported into VeroRoute.


4) Making your own symbols
==========================

There are a few things that you need to do to produce symbols that will export correctly.

a) Give them a "refdes" attribute.
   This will become the "Name" in VeroRoute.
b) Give them a "device" attribute.
   This will become the "Value" in VeroRoute.
   Do not use the "value" attribute in gEDA.  Always use
   the "device" attribute to represent value.
c) Give them a "footprint" attribute that VeroRoute understands.
   See the provided symbols for examples.
d) Use pin numbers that match the VeroRoute pin numbers.
   See the provided symbols for examples.

You can add a "description" attribute if it helps you
work with the symbol in gEDA but this will not be exported.
